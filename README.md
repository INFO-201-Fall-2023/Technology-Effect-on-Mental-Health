# Story Pitch
Since the start of the digital age that we currently live in, our lives have revolved around technology. From TVs to laptops to phones to even watches, it is hard to find yourself not being connected to some sort of technology. While technology has brought numerous benefits to society, including increased connectivity and access to information, there is growing concern about its impact on human well-being, especially with the drastic rise in social media usage. From mental health to social relationships, technology use can have both positive and negative effects on our lives.

With the meteoric rise of apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, a lot of scrutiny has been placed on what effects these apps are having on people, especially children. Anxiety and depression are at an all-time high among not just children, but all Americans, and suicide rates are following the same trend. This is leading to people wondering if these apps are having a negative effect due to things such as comparisons to other children, cyberbullying, and addiction.

However, it is undeniable that social media also has major benefits to the world. One of the primary benefits of social media is social connection, which allows people to connect with friends and family, even if they are far away. Social media platforms provide a convenient and accessible way to stay in touch with loved ones, share photos and updates, and maintain relationships. Additionally, social media platforms offer a wealth of information and resources, including news updates, educational materials, and creative content. They provide a space for creative expression, where individuals can showcase their talents and skills, collaborate with others, and receive feedback from a wider audience.

Our central theme is that technology has both positive and negative effects on human well-being, and we believe this is an interesting and compelling story because it affects us all. With the rise of social media and the internet, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on our well-being is a topic of growing concern. By exploring this topic through data visualization, we hope to provide a unique perspective on this issue and offer practical insights into how we can use technology in healthier and more productive ways.

We plan to tell a compelling story that engages and informs our audience about the complex relationship between technology and human well-being. We believe that our project will be of interest to anyone who uses technology and is concerned about the impact it may be having on their life. In particular, parents of younger children and teenagers can use our study and monitor technology and social media usage. Our aim is to provide a deeper understanding of this topic and to offer practical strategies for using technology in more beneficial ways, ultimately leading to improved well-being for individuals and society as a whole.
