## Story Pitch
Since the start of the digital age that we currently live in, our lives have revolved around technology. From TVs to laptops to phones to even watchesCancel changes, it is hard to find yourself not being connected to some sort of technology. While technology has brought numerous benefits to society, including increased connectivity and access to information, there is growing concern about its impact on human well-being, especially with the drastic rise in social media usage. From mental health to social relationships, technology use can have both positive and negative effects on our lives.

With the meteoric rise of apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, a lot of scrutiny has been placed on what effects these apps are having on people, especially children. Anxiety and depression are at an all-time high among not just children, but all Americans, and suicide rates are following the same trend. This is leading to people wondering if these apps are having a negative effect due to things such as comparisons to other children, cyberbullying, and addiction.

However, it is undeniable that social media also has major benefits to the world. One of the primary benefits of social media is social connection, which allows people to connect with friends and family, even if they are far away. Social media platforms provide a convenient and accessible way to stay in touch with loved ones, share photos and updates, and maintain relationships. Additionally, social media platforms offer a wealth of information and resources, including news updates, educational materials, and creative content. They provide a space for creative expression, where individuals can showcase their talents and skills, collaborate with others, and receive feedback from a wider audience.

Our central theme is that technology has both positive and negative effects on human well-being, and we believe this is an interesting and compelling story because it affects us all. With the rise of social media and the internet, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on our well-being is a topic of growing concern. By exploring this topic through data visualization, we hope to provide a unique perspective on this issue and offer practical insights into how we can use technology in healthier and more productive ways.

We plan to tell a compelling story that engages and informs our audience about the complex relationship between technology and human well-being. We believe that our project will be of interest to anyone who uses technology and is concerned about the impact it may be having on their life. In particular, parents of younger children and teenagers can use our study and monitor technology and social media usage. Our aim is to provide a deeper understanding of this topic and to offer practical strategies for using technology in more beneficial ways, ultimately leading to improved well-being for individuals and society as a whole.


## Finding Data
##### 1) Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/technology-teen-dating-violence-and-abuse-and-bullying-in-three-states-2011-2012
##### 2) How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
General data was collected for impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness. This data also talks about the effect of social media during the lockdown. However, this data can also be used to examine the use of social media and technology on mental health over that period of time by comparing it to another dataset. The goal of the other dataset was to expand knowledge about the types of abuse experiences youth have, and the extent of victimization, and perpetration via technology and new media. This project carried out a multi-state study of teen dating violence and abuse, and bullying, the main component of which included a survey of youth from ten schools in five school districts in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, gathering information from 5,647 youth about their experiences. For our group, we have data as mentioned at the top, one talks about mental health, and the other talks about the issue of social networking.  
##### 3) How many observations (rows) are in your data?
There are fourteen observations (rows) in our data set and the other one has eleven observations (rows).
##### 4) How many features (columns) are in the data?
There are 1290 columns in the first data and the other one has 1139 columns. 

## Background Research/Inspiration
https://etactics.com/blog/negative-effects-of-technology-on-mental-health

This source talks about how technology and specifically our phones have negative effect on our mental health, This is a direct example the effects on mental health which we mentioned in our pitch

This should provide some good information and get us thinking about technology in our lives, the data is too broad and mostly based on surveys so we canâ€™t really directly use it though. 

https://www.marriage.com/advice/relationship/technology-and-relationships/

This is another source that is pretty specific in its focus, it talks specifically about how technology affects our relationships. This is another piece of what we wanted to talk about.

This might be a little too specific and it focuses on the problem of relationships only so it is different that exactly what we want out project to focus on but it should serve a good purpose still.

https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/12/10/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-humans/

This source was surprisingly relevant to what we were looking at, a lot of this article talks about how technology affects society as a whole and not so much human health, but it does talk about how these changes in society will affect the average person 

There is a part of this article talks about the positive things that AI, which is a form of technology, will do for humans like diagnosing disease and helping with health research, this a good example of how technology can help human well-being which is different than the other sources so far

This is a great source that talks about a more psychological effect that technology has on us

This is very helpful and provides the basis of a lot of what we intend to talk about in our project. This is very similar to our overall pitch.

https://www.healthtechzone.com/topics/healthcare/articles/2021/02/19/448068-5-ways-technology-has-improved-our-quality-life.htm

This source is very nice and provides another positive angle to view technology from. We can use this in order to think about how technology will help us in the future

With this source we can see the ways we already benefit from technology daily, with this info we can try to draw parallels to how we can be better in the future. I think this could be really helpful in allowing us to look forwards and apply technology better in our project.
